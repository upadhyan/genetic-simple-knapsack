# Evolutionary Approach to the 0-1 Knapsack Problem

This project was an exploration of using Simple Evolutionary Algorithms to find an optimal solution to the [Binary Knapsack Problem](https://codecrucks.com/binary-knapsack-problem-using-greedy-algorithm/). The main goals of this were to examine how changing various parameters of the algorithm may impact the generated solutions. Different crossover and mutation methods were also tested as well. 

The code for the algorithms can be found in [knapsack_functions.R](https://github.com/upadhyan/genetic-simple-knapsack/blob/main/knapsack_functions.R) and the executions of various data collection tests can be found in [test_executions.Rmd](https://github.com/upadhyan/genetic-simple-knapsack/blob/main/test_executions.Rmd). The full report on the findings can be found in [0_1_Knapsack_EA.pdf](https://github.com/upadhyan/genetic-simple-knapsack/blob/main/0_1_Knapsack_EA.pdf)
